# TH Project 7

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the seventh Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

This project was built using the create-react-app feature. Using the Flickr API, this project works as an 
alternative frontend to the Flickr search feature by querying the API with Axios. The frontend was built via
React components.
